Potato Plant Disease Detection & Smart Irrigation System
This project is designed to detect diseases in potato plants using AI and automate irrigation based on environmental conditions. It combines machine learning for disease classification with an IoT-based monitoring system.
Features:
Upload images of potato leaves to detect diseases
Uses a deep learning model for classification
IoT-based smart irrigation system with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors
Remote monitoring and control via Firebase
User-friendly dashboard for real-time updates
 Tech Stack:
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
IoT Hardware: Soil moisture sensor, Temperature & Humidity sensor (DHT11/DHT22), Relay module
Cloud: Firebase for storing disease detection results
Frontend: html, CSS, js
Backend: Python (Flask)
